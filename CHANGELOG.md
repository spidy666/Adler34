# Changelog

All notable changes to **34-0 — Eintracht Frankfurt Bundesliga Dream Team** are documented here.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-08

### Changed
- **Three-tier position compatibility system** replaces the old binary compatible/incompatible model
  - **Green** = player's natural position exactly matches the slot — no penalty (factor 1.0)
  - **Yellow** = slot is in the player's historically documented `altPositions` array — small penalty (factor 0.88, −12 %)
  - **Red** = no match at all — hefty penalty (factor 0.65, −35 %)
  - Removed `POS_COMPAT` broad-compatibility matrix. Slot colour is now derived purely from each player's individual `position` and `altPositions` data, not a generic positional adjacency table
  - Draft filter (click a slot during deal phase) now shows green cards (main fit), yellow cards (alt fit), and dims non-fitting players
  - `positionFit` property (`'main'` | `'alt'` | `'out'`) replaces the old boolean `inPosition` flag
  - Engine penalty increased for fully incompatible placements (was 25 %, now 35 %)

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Position table calibrated to real Bundesliga standings (2014/15–2023/24)**
  - 43 pts now correctly maps to ~9th place (was incorrectly showing 6th)
  - 73 pts maps to 2nd place (Stuttgart's 2023/24 result)
  - 40 pts maps to 10th place
  - Full ladder: 78+ → 1st, 68+ → 2nd, 60+ → 3rd, 55+ → 4th, 50+ → 5th, 45+ → 6th, 41+ → 8th, 37+ → 10th, 32+ → 12th, 27+ → 14th, 22+ → 16th (Playoff), 16+ → 17th (Abstieg)
  - Updated `isEuropa` threshold (50 pts) and `isRelegated` threshold (<27 pts) to match

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **`POS_COMPAT` tightened** — previous matrix was far too permissive, causing most OOP placements to show green (compatible) and receive no engine penalty
  - `MF` was compatible with RW, LW, RB, LB — now only DM and AM
  - `RB`/`LB` were compatible with MF — now fullbacks only swap among RB/CB/LB
  - `CF` was compatible with RW/LW — now only stretches to AM
  - `RW`/`LW` were compatible with MF and CF — now only AM and the opposite wing
  - Individual player `altPositions` in `players.js` handle real historical flexibility beyond these defaults

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Engine now uses slot position weights** — the fundamental fix for the out-of-position exploit
  - Previously: engine used `player.position` (natural role) for `POSITION_WEIGHTS` regardless of where the player was placed. Two CFs placed as defenders still scored as CFs (attack weight 2.5 each)
  - Now: engine uses `slot.pos` (where they actually play). A CF in the GK slot is scored with GK weights — high defence requirement, near-zero attack
  - `slotPos` is now passed from the simulate handler alongside `inPosition`
  - OOP penalty increased to 25 % (was 18 %)
  - Win probability formula updated: `0.12 × totalPower − 0.63`

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Simulation engine recalibrated** after further over-easy results (54 pts with mostly OOP squad)
  - `goalBonus` multiplier reduced from ×0.20 to ×0.04 (max attack multiplier ×1.12 instead of ×1.60)
  - `appBonus` multiplier reduced from ×0.10 to ×0.02 (max midfield multiplier ×1.04 instead of ×1.20)
  - Frankfurt players all have high career stats so large bonuses inflated everyone equally — the bonuses no longer dominate the score
  - Added 18 % rating penalty (`posFactor = 0.82`) for players placed outside their compatible positions
  - `inPosition` flag passed from `index.html` simulate handler using `playerFitsSlot(player, slot.pos)`
  - Era diversity bonus range tightened from 0.85–1.05 to 0.90–1.04
  - Updated `estimatePosition` and result thresholds

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Critical engine bug: game was unwinnable to lose**
  - `winProb = 0.18 + 0.09 × totalPower` with typical squad power of 7–10 produced values of 0.81–1.08
  - Capped at 0.88 with `drawProb = 0.18` → `lossProb = −0.06` (negative) → team could never lose
  - Even a 74-rated single-era squad was getting 29+ wins per season
  - **Fix**: new formula `min(0.68, max(0.18, 0.07 × totalPower − 0.14))`, `drawProb` raised to 0.22
  - `lossProb` is now always positive; max win probability capped at 68 %

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **German position labels throughout** — player cards now show `TW`, `IV`, `RV`, `LV`, `DM`, `MF`, `OM`, `RA`, `LA`, `ST` instead of English codes (`GK`, `CB`, `RB`, etc.)
- **Alt positions visible in draft cards** — secondary positions shown in a small label next to the primary (also in German)
- **Slot click filter during draft** — clicking an empty pitch slot in deal mode highlights compatible players (green border) and dims incompatible ones. Click again to clear
- `POS_DE` mapping object and `posDE()` helper function
- `playerFitsSlot()` now checks both main position and `altPositions` for compatibility
- CSS classes: `.slot-active`, `.slot-match`, `.slot-dim`
- **Compatible slot check extended to `altPositions`** — `renderPitch` in place mode now correctly shows green for players whose alt positions fit the target slot
